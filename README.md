# odin-landing-page
This will be my submission for the Landing Page assignment from The Odin Project.
We are given an image of a landing page example, and our task is to replicate it.
Link to the lesson: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page
The link also contains links to their example images.

I was using relative values for everything that they didn't detail, so I'm pretty
sure that is the reason why it doesn't look quite right at any width except for 1440
like their example is. I know they said "not to worry about making it look good on
mobile," but I don't want to get bad habits.

Also, I'm fairly certain that it isn't ADA/WCAG compliant. I know that isn't the 
point of this assignment, but still. I started to go back and fix it, but since the
site is just for show, I wasn't sure about the exact semantics.
